<h2>Hatching your eggs!</h2>
			<h3>Incubation</h3>
			<p>
				You can buy or even build your own incubator fairly easily. The eggs need
				to be turned regularly to help prevent the developing chick from
				sticking to the inside of the shell. Japanese quail eggs require a
				temperature of 37.5 degrees C, or 99.5 degrees if you work in farenheit,
				in order to incubate and develop properly. You should cease turning eggs
				after around day 14, this is known as lockdown, as far as i can tell
				this is because the now nearly fully developed chick is not at risk of
				sticking to the inside of the egg.

			<h3>Into the brooder</h3>
			<p>
				Once hatched, quail chicks can remain in the incubator for upto 24 hours.
				They can be safely removed as soon as their fuzzy chick down is dry, and
				from then on need to be put in a larger enclosure called a "brooder".
				A brooder is designed to keep the chicks warm until their feathers have
				fully developed, as until that point they cannot regulate their
				body temperatures by themselves. The brooder needs a floor covered with
				material that provides good traction for the chicks, as "splay leg" can
				be a real issue.
			</p>
			<p>
				Splay leg is a common health condition in baby quail, it can be brought
				on by a wide range of different things including:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Incorrect incubating perameters
					</li>
					<li>
						Slipping and sliding on the incubator or brooder floor
					</li>
					<li>
						Improper nutrition in the parents
					</li>
				</ul>
				Whilst very common, it is also very treatable especially if caught
				early. Whatever the underlying reason for the condition, the problem is
				usually strain or damage to the muscles in the chicks hips. Keeping
				their legs underneath them and the chick immobile usually does the
				trick for me. I have achieved this by putting the little bird inside a
				shot glass near, but not too near, the heat source. I usually do this
				overnight.

			<p>
				There are a few ways to heat a brooder, most commonly with a red heat
				lamp. I say a red lamp specifically as a full spectrum white lamp will
				make it difficult for the chicks to sleep at night, which is not a good
				thing. I have also had some success with using a reptile heat mat
				beneath a layer of tissue paper. There are also "fake" hens available,
				which provide heat from above just like a real mother would.
