    <h3><i>What are they?</i></h3>
    <p> <em>Japanese Quail</em> are a species of game bird in the pheasant
        family. Frequently kept for meat and eggs, these diminutive birds are
        incredibly versatile (and CUTE!). They have been kept since at least the
        12th century as domesticated animals (according to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_quail">Wikipedia</a>).
        Quail are very easy to care for, as you will see. They will live happily
        in a rabbit hutch or aviary. Some people even keep them in cages,
        however
        I personally feel more space is better for birds, even tiny ones like
        these!
