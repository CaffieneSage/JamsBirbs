		<h3><i>What are they?</i></h3>
		<p> <em>Japanese Quail</em> are a species of game bird in the pheasant
			family. Frequently kept for meat and eggs, these diminutive birds are
			incredibly versatile (and CUTE!). They have been kept since at least the
			12th century as domesticated animals according to 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_quail">Wikipedia</a>
			Quail are very easy to care for, as you will see. They will live happily
			in a rabbit hutch or aviary. Some people even keep them in cages,
			however
			I personally feel more space is better for birds, even tiny ones like
			these!

		<h3>How do I care for my birds?</h3>

		<img class="cute" src="../assets/images/Cute.jpg" alt=" " width="250" height="250" align="left">
		<p>As with any pet, birds have needs, and quail are no different! They need
			somewhere clean to live, I highly recommend a good hutch setup. They
			need food in the form of game bird feed, ideally with a higher protein
			level than for eg. chickens. They should ideally also be given leafy greens regularly,
			alongside some kind of grit that is rich in calcium. </p>
		<p>
			If you are intending to breed your birds then it is usually a good idea
			to keep 1 male or "roo", to every 3 to 5 female "hens". You should usually
			be able to collect 1 egg per day per hen, which can then be put in an
			incubator for hatching or in the fridge for eating. Some people dont
			like the idea of eating fertilised eggs, but from my experience there isn't much 
			difference.
