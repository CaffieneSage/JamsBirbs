    <p>As with any pet, birds have needs, and quail are no different! They need
        somewhere clean to live, I highly recommend a good hutch setup. They
        need food in the form of game bird feed, ideally with a higher protein
        level than for eg. chickens. They should ideally also be given leafy greens regularly,
        alongside some kind of grit that is rich in calcium. </p>

        If you are intending to breed your birds then it is usually a good idea
        to keep 1 male or "roo", to every 3 to 5 female "hens". You should usually
        be able to collect 1 egg per day per hen, which can then be put in an
        incubator for hatching or in the fridge for eating. Some people dont
        like the idea of eating fertilised eggs, but from my experience there really
        isn't much of a difference.
