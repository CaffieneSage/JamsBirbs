  <h2>What are they?</h2>

  <body>
    <p> <em>Japanese Quail</em> are a species of game bird in the pheasant
      family. Frequently kept for meat and eggs, these diminutive birds are
      incredibly versatile (and CUTE!). They have been kept since at least the
      12th century as domesticated animals (according to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_quail">Wikipedia</a>).
      Quail are very easy to care for, as you will see. They will live happily
      in a rabbit hutch or aviary. Some people even keep them in cages, however
      I personally feel more space is better for birds, even tiny ones like
      these!

    <p>As with any pet, birds have needs, and quail are no different! They need
      somewhere clean to live, I highly reccomend a good hutch setup. they
    need food in the form of game bird feed, ideally with a higher protein
    level. </p>
