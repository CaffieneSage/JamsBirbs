    <h2><i>What are they?</i></h2>
    <p> <em>Japanese Quail</em> are a species of game bird in the pheasant
      family. Frequently kept for meat and eggs, these diminutive birds are
      incredibly versatile (and CUTE!). They have been kept since at least the
      12th century as domesticated animals (according to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_quail">Wikipedia</a>).
      Quail are very easy to care for, as you will see. They will live happily
      in a rabbit hutch or aviary. Some people even keep them in cages, however
      I personally feel more space is better for birds, even tiny ones like
      these!
    </p>
    <h3>How do I care for my birds?</h3>
    <img src="Cute.jpg" alt="Hello?." width="300" height="300" align="center">
    <p>As with any pet, birds have needs, and quail are no different! They need
      somewhere clean to live, I highly reccomend a good hutch setup. they
      need food in the form of game bird feed, ideally with a higher protein
      level. They should ideally also be given leafy greens regularly,
      alongside some kind of grit that is rich in calcium. </p>
    <p>
      If you are intending to breed your birds then it is usually a good idea to
      keep 1 male or "roo", to every 3 to 5 female "hens". You should usually be
      able to collect 1 egg per day per hen, which can then be put in an
      incubator for hatching or in the fridge for eating. Some people dont like
      the idea of eating fertilised eggs, but from my experience there really
      isn't alot of difference.
    </p>


    <br />
    <h2>Hatching your eggs!</h2>
    <h3>Incubation</h3>
    <p>
      You can buy or even build your own incubator fairly easily. The eggs need
      to be turned regularly to help prevent the developing chick from
      sticking to the inside of the shell. Japanese quail eggs require a
      temperature of 37.5 degrees C, or 99.5 degrees if you work in farenheit,
      in order to incubate and develop properly. You should cease turning eggs
      after around day 14, this is known as lockdown, as far as i can tell
      this is because the now nearly fully developed chick is not at risk of
      sticking to the inside of the egg.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Into the brooder</h3>
    <p>
      Once hatched, quail chicks can remain in the incubator for upto 24 hours.
      They can be safely removed as soon as their fuzzy chick down is dry, and
      from then on need to be put in a larger enclosure called a "brooder".
      A brooder is designed to keep the chicks warm until their feathers have
      fully developed, as until that point they cannot regulate their
      body temperatures by themselves. The brooder needs a floor covered with
      material that provides good traction for the chicks, as "splay leg" can
      be a real issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Splay leg is a common health condition in baby quail, it can be brought
      on by a wide range of different things including:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Incorrect incubating perameters
      </li>
      <li>
        Slipping and sliding on the incubator or brooder floor
      </li>
      <li>
        Improper nutrition in the parents
      </li>
    </ul>
    Whilst very common, it is also very treatable especially if caught
    early. Whatever the underlying reason for the condition, the problem is
    usually strain or damage to the muscles in the chicks hips. Keeping
    their legs underneath them and the chick immobile usually does the
    trick for me. I have achieved this by putting the little bird inside a
    shot glass near, but not too near, the heat source. I usually do this
    overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few ways to heat a brooder, most commonly with a red heat
      lamp. I say a red lamp specifically as a full spectrum white lamp will
      make it difficult for the chicks to sleep at night, which is not a good
      thing. I have also had some success with using a reptile heat mat
      beneath a layer of tissue paper. There are also "fake" hens available,
      which provide heat from above just like a real mother would.
